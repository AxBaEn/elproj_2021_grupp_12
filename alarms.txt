How to use:
Please end the list of alarms with an "#" on a new row. That marks the end of the list.
To enter an alarm, write the time xx:xx followed by either a 10 character message, or the word "dose".
If you enter "dose", the Rosetten will dispense its next content at that time.
If you enter a 10 character message, the Rosetten will only display that message at that time withoput dispenssing.
